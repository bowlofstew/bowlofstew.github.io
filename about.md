I am a senior software developer at [Channel IQ](http://www.channeliq.com/)
in Chicago.  Channel IQ is a leader in online price monitoring, brand
protection, and competitive intelligence.  We attack big data head on with
many cutting edge technologies.

Prior to Channel IQ, I worked in the trading industry working on mid to high
frequency trading & derivatives pricing.
