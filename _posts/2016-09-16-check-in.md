Its been 2 days since the last update.  The delay is due to 2 late nights at the Google Chicago office for their Sandbox event.  The event was to provide more information to developers, students, and other groups about Google.  Day #1 was interesting and had a wide variety from speakers from product managers, engineers, to engineers in test. 

During day #2, we performed a number a small coding lab in which we created a small Android VR program utilizing Google Cardboard.  I had already done similar programming in Android so I floated around and helped out some commrades.

For anyone wanting to do the lab:
