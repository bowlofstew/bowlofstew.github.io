*Week Review - 7/19/2015*
-----

At work. I was knee deep in docker setup. I primarily worked on getting a base log container setup to forward logs via rsyslog to a a log server, Graylog2.  

For my personal projects, I began work on a small disassembly engine.

Useful Github repos:

  * [Graylog2 images - logging](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-images)
