Things that I have sucked at (extremely):
  
  * Maintaining a blog - It is much harder than one might think!

  * Over working out

Things that I rocked at today:

  * Going to meetings - coded for a solid 55 minutes today

Things that I learned today:

  * Removing downloads from jcenter in SBT required me to completely refresh my memory of SBT.  The more that I use SBT, the less I like it.  Here was the magic.

  * Scala in the hands of an evil do-er....makes the obfusticated C competition look like a joke

  * It is never too early to deploy to production when no one is using the environment yet

Awesome Chicago happenings this week:

  * [Google Sandbox Chicago](https://events.withgoogle.com/google-sandbox-chicago-1/) - I'll be there.

  * Migrated to Comcast Business Class at the home as the new data caps weren't going to cut it.  Pretty excited to not be bound by data caps now.

Things I want to go to but can't :(

  * [The Current State of C++ Unikernels and the Future](https://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Bay-Area/events/231535062/) - So jealous
