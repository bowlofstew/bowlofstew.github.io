Podcasts I Listen To

Here are the podcasts that I am presently binging on:

[Jocko Podcast](http://jockopodcast2.com)

I am a huge fan of Jocko's podcast and his book, [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2).  There are so many treasures buried in both the book and the podcast relating to leadership, problem solving, and even creativity.  I can't recommend this enough.

[The Tim Ferriss Show](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/)

Love it and the recent [Tools of Titans](https://toolsoftitans.com/) book.  I have mined out many gems from these episodes.  That being said, I have also been able to walk away from several with nothing to show.

[Ben Greenfield Fitness: Diet, Fat Loss and Performance](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com)

I am becoming a huge fan of these health & fitness podcasts.  This is one of the best that I have ran into so far.  His book, [Beyond Training](Beyond Training) is solid as well.

[The Way I Heard It with Mike Rowe](http://www.mikerowe.com/podcast)

My daughter got my household addicted to this.  She was a fan of Dirty Jobs and found this.  Everyone here is now addicted.  Besides who is your favorite ex-host of a TV show that was always covered in something stinky?

[Dan Carlin's Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com)

So good and in depth but as a warning each episode is a major time commitment!  The last episode around nuclear weapons weighed in at over 6 hours!

[Smart Drug Smarts: Brain Optimization](http://smartdrugsmarts.com)

In the spirit of more bio-hacking, I began listening (and implementing).  So far, so good but not a super human yet!
