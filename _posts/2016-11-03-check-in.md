I suck at blogging.  No updates since 10/18/2016, fail.

I will get this updated more frequently, promise.  I feel compelled to start 
this off with a "Go Cubs!" statement.  

In the time since the last update, I was inspired by [John Washam's](https://github.com/jwasham) Github project 
called [google-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) to rewatch all of 
Erik Demaine's [Advanced Data Structures course](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/).  This was part of my absence in 
blog form.  For personal enrichment, I picked up a copy of [The Daily Stoic](http://amzn.to/2flGEBI) and am digging it so far.  It 
isn't as much of a read all of once type of text as much as read a small-bite-each-day-for-reflection-type of text.

Observations:

  * Zenefits or whatever they call themselves these days is superior to ADP in everyway that I have seen so far.

  * Exporting passwords from PasswordBox to anything else is pretty hard.

  * [KetoSoy](http://amzn.to/2eseZkX) is a great replacement to [Soylent](http://amzn.to/2eiBKnY) given 
  their latest round of supply chain issues.
