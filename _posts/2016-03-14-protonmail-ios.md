I have recently had the chance to check out the ProtonMail iOS application.  I have been using it for 3 days now.  For a newly released application, I would say that it was outstanding.  It has all of the features that you would come to expect from a mobile email application:

  * Drafting (write/save/discard)

  * Move messages around to different folders

  * Slide manipulation for spam/delete

  * Ability to star messages

  * Abiltiy to archive messages

  * Built-in contacts

  * Built-in bug reporting mechanism

  * Labels

 Things that it doesn't support that other email clients presently have:

  * Multiple account support

  * Reminders (event and email reminder)

  * Calendar integration

I suspect the later 2 items are more of a feature as it leaks information across applications. Protonmail -> Google Calender for example.

I have been on the edge of switching from my Google email account for awhile now.  I had been looking for a secure email platform with a mobile application for awhile.  Protonmail's hard work on both their web and mobile platform has made me a believer.
