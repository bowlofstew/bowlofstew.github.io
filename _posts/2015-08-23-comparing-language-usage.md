After reading Dan Luu's post titled "What Are C, C++, and Java Used For?", I figured that I would add my own version of it.  I enjoyed this post as it covers several use cases.  In this post, I will expand this post style to cover Scala and a few other languages.

Assembly:

  * Old school video games [example](http://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&share=1)
  
  * Compilers

  * Debuggers

C:

  * Many financial applications such as Bloomberg

  * Most operating system's kernel & drivers (Windows, Linux)

C++:
  
  * Most web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, whatever MS has now)

  * Most games (IdTech, Unity, etc)

  * Most of Facebook

Erlang:

  * Ericsson

  * T-Mobile
  
  * WhatsApp

Java:

  * Most of Netflix

  * Most software as a service (SAS) stacks

Racket:

  * [Oculus](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/577877590070919168) 

OCaml:

  * Jane Street Capital

Scala:

  * Coursera

  * Box

  * Twitter services

I wanted to find some usages of esolangs but it was difficult to find production usages of them.
