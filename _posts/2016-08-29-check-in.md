Things I have sucked at:

  * Being consistent at keeping the blog going.

Today I learned:

  * It is hard to parse `gradle dependencies` in a reasonable way.

  * Potbelly sugar cookies have 530 calories each! Too bad I had already ate 2 by that time...

  * Converting over a Scala project from gradle to bazel is harder than I initially though.  I am still trying to nail down the best pattern for a mixed Scala/Java project here.  I'll push the example code to Github when I am happy with a design.

  * Adding unit tests when there was previously no unit tests is a bottomless pit.

  * When a developer forgets his computer at work, endless mockery ensues.  Note to self, never do this.

Blog posts that I read today:

  * [How C++14 and C++17 help to write faster code](https://kfrlib.com/blog/how-c14-and-c17-help-to-write-faster-and-better-code-real-world-examples/)

  * [A pattern bandage for messy virtual functions](https://mortoray.com/2016/08/29/a-pattern-bandage-for-messy-virtual-functions/)

Side note:

Several people I know at a former company were let go today after some corporate bloodletting.  They are proficient in Cassandra, Scala, and Spark.  Ping me if you need some good developers.
