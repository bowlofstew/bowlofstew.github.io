Today was demo day.  This is a day were a (tech) business has some or all of their teams present their work for some period of time.  This usually aligns with a sprint in [Agile-land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).  My team had little to demo this cycle as it wasn't quite ready.

Oberservations:

  * Demos don't work well for backend teams mostly focused on data ingestion, execution of models, or [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) processes.  It seems to make sense to combine these with front-end teams.  Avoid silo-ing teams into front-end and back-end.

  * All teams go thru rough patches so don't expect a demo from every team, every period.

  * Never demo from your machine.  It always leads to someone thinking this business feature is in production available for sales or usage.  If it's not in production, its not real.  This is especially important if clients are present in the demo!

  * Don't sacrifice quality for demos.  Did it pass code review, [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) builds, and is the test coverage?  If not, its probably [vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware).  

  * Always have an out if a live demo doesn't work.  You would be surprised when components fail.  Screencasts are awesome backups.
