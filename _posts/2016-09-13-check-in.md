Today:

  * Tracked down an interesting bug in a obfustication module (along with 8 other issues; hooray static analysis)

  * Worked on a [change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) design.  This is an interesting problem especially when using a third-party solution to scrape transaction logs from databases that were created before my birth.  I would love to write my own transaction log scraping application (will probably do soon and open source).

  * Tracked down a few deployment issues in which environment variables weren't correctly being passed into a docker container from Marathon.  These kind of issues become major time sinks.  I would love to automate detection of this in the future.

  * Meetings & Interviews with potential developers
