*Polyphasic Sleep*
-----

I am the kind of person that gets these comments far too often:

  * Why were you responding to emails at 3 AM?

  * Those code commits or code reviews were done at a crazy hour!

Yes, I am awake more than most.  This all started back in college.  I wasn't entirely sure what it was called at the time or if it even had a name.  It was only in the last handful of years did I find out a proper name for this.  [Polyphasic sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep) is dividing your sleep up into multiple phases.  Most of these have be given well defined names already.  Here are the names and associated hours of sleep with each cycle:

  *  Dual Core 2 - 4.6 hours

  *  Dual Core 3 - 4 hours

  *  Triphasic - 4.5 hours

  *  Dymaxion - 2 hours

  *  Everyman (1, 2, 3) - ~4 hours

  *  Trimaxion - 3 hours

  *  Segmented - 7 hours

  *  Segmented Siesta - 5.5 hours

I initially started on a version of the everyman sleep cycle in college and have gradually migrated to the dymaxion over time.  There are some common questions I get about this:

  *  Is this healthy?  Probably not but I haven't seen great evidence either way

  *  Do you get bored at night?  Absolutely!  It does get boring after my wife and child go to bed.  It was important for me to develop a to-do list prior to the night.  I basically just drive thru a list of tasks each night then leverage any extra time on reading, writing, and learning tasks.

  *  Do you snack all night?  No but the urge is STRONG!

Tools that I use:

  *  [napchart](https://napchart.com) - This is a great software (open source too) for creating nap schedules.

  *  [Smart Sleep Polyphasic Planner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-sleep-polyphasic-planner/id938423078?mt=8) - I believe that this app has been abandoned by I still use it as there is no replacement.

  *  [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) - I track my naps with this app but the granualarity of the wake up time often creates issues.
