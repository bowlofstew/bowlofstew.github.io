Today:

  * Interviews

  * Meetings

    * Daily standup

    * Sprint planning

    * Retro

      * This went way better than expected considering our team has been without a retrospective in over a month....don't ask

  * Programming

    * Mostly constrained to a debugging task that has been haunting our team for some time now.

Awesome happenings:

  * Was upgraded to [Signal iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8) with connectivity to [signal-desktop](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en)!

Tonight's Hobby Project:

Create a small Java RPC server that will provide a thin layer over ElasticSearch with very basic authorization.  

Technologies involved:

  * [Bazel](http://bazel.io/)

  * [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

  * [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)

From what I can tell, there is a now a directive in bazel, [proto_library](http://bazel.io/docs/be/protocol-buffer.html) that should handle most of the pains that I had before.  Looking at the [recent comments](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/52) in the Bazel issue tracker on Github, my hopes are pretty higher.  The issues that I had previously was that there was about the same level of custom scripting involved as there would be with other build systems such as CMake.

Why you may ask?  I have been wanting to learn GRPC and we have a similar technology in use at our company that I am going to try and deprecate in the near future.
