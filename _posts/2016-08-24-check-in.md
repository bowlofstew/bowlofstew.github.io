Today was a good day getting back into software development after yesterdays long Agile excursion.

Things I did well today:

  * Starting Soylent....tastes like somewhat sweet flour

  * Figuring out a few Spark job performance issues

  * Starting to exercise again

Things that I learned:

  * Java concurrency & Scala concurrency don't play well together...there are many interops between Java and Scala but this ain't one of them.

  * Spark job & task logging across multiple slaves in Mesos leaves much to be desired.

  * The [bazel-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss) group is pretty bad a$$.

Things that didn't go well:

  * My first attempt at getting boost to build under Bazel was a failure.  My next approach will be based upon nelhage's [rules_boost](https://github.com/nelhage/rules_boost) repo.  My ultimate goal is to get Boost ASIO working for a networking hobby project.

Things I am reading:

  * [Does a compiler use all x86 instructions?](http://pepijndevos.nl/2016/08/24/x86-instruction-distribution.html)

  * [Borg, Omega, and Kubernetes](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub44843.html)
