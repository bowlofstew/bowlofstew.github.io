Designing Good (REST) APIs

Let's start this off with a brief question, what is a good API?  What is a bad API?  Having 
the priviledge of working with both, there are signs:

  * Is it API versioned?  Does it have a latest endpoint set?  If no, prepare for pain.

  * Is the API payload versioned? 

  * Is it as small as possible?

  * Does it make sense?  Example of not making sense: ID path variable in the url and also in the payload.

  * Does it have system-wide side effects?  Does calling the endpoint trigger a message into a messaging system that 
  causes other asynchronous things to happen?  That is completely cool but make sure you can trace messages going thru 
  your system or you're going to have a bad time.

  * Do you have behavior tests and unit tests around your API?

  * Do your consumers have [PACT](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) tests?
