At Channel IQ, I am a senior developer working on some pretty cool problems.  
During the course of a typical day, I vary between a few programming languages
such as Java, Scala, and Python.  The tools I (most of us) use are as follows:

Java:

  * IntelliJ - lombok plugin
  * Projects powered by Maven or Gradle
  * Common libraries: CodaHale, Logback, Hibernate, Spark,
                      Project Lombok, Kafka

Scala:

  * IntelliJ - Scala plugin
  * Projects powered by SBT
  * Common libraries: Akka, SubCut, CodaHale, Spray, Logback,
                      Salat, Kafka

Python:

  * PyCharm
  * Common libraries: kafka-python, redis, scales, urlparse

Chef:

  * RubyMine: works so-so for the Chef DSL.  Jetbrain's is working on
              adding support to handle this soon!

Common:

  * GIT
  * Jenkins
  * SonarQube
  * Nexus
