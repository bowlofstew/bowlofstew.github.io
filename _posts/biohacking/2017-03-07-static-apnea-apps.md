*Static Apnea for n00bs*
-----

Not many people think about it but you take between 17,000 and 30,000 breaths per day.  I recently began to focus not only on how many breaths that I take but also the quality of those when learning about [the Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/){:target="_blank"}.  I begin to wonder what metrics should I even be looking at?

  * How long can I hold my breath?

  * How many breaths do I need when at rest?

  * How many breaths do I need when active?

In answering the question of how long can I hold my breath, I started with a basic stopwatch and attempting to go for it.  The results were not impressive at 1 minute, 34 seconds.  I did some research and 
found that many divers work to improve this process thru a training called static apnea training.

What is [static apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_apnea){:target="_blank"}?  According to Wikipedia, static apnea is a discipline in which a person holds their breath (**apnea**) underwater for as long as possible, and need not swim any distance.  This training is based upon a generated set of tables that represent the hold times that an individual should hold their breath to build sustained oxygen ([**O<sub>2</sub>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen){:target="_blank"}) and carbon dioxide ([**CO<sub>2</sub>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide){:target="_blank"}) tolerance within your body.  The training to build the ability to work at these 2 sustained levels is typically broken down into separate tables called O2 and CO2 tables respectively.  


## Table design

A table is broken into 2 phases.  Those are:

  * **Ventilation** - Breathing in and out

  * **Apnea** - Holding your breath


## CO<sub>2</sub> Table

This table provides a series of breath holds that is intended to give the trainees body less oxygen at each interval thereby increasing the sustained level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the bloodstream during training.  Over the course of several trainings, the trainees body should be able to adapt to an increased level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the body.


## O<sub>2</sub> Table

From my understanding, an O<sub>2</sub> table trainings goal is to increase the maximum breath hold time of the trainee.  The difference here between the CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> tables is that the breathing phase of this table is constant whereas in the CO<sub>2</sub> table, the hold phas is constant.


## Hybrid Tables

I have seen 2 alternate table kinds across the space which I will briefly mention.

  * [**Pranayama**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama){:target="_blank"} - a controlled form of breathing that is typically part of a Yoga practice.  This is another form of an O<sub>2</sub> table.

  * **Wonka** - A CO<sub>2</sub> style table that was named after Richard Wonka of [WeDive](https://wefreedive.com/resources/training/2-the-evolution-of-co2-training-tables#ancient){:target="_blank"}.  It serves to increase the efficiency of a table to produce an increased level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the bloodstream.


## Example Tables


### CO<sub>2</sub> Table

| Repetition | Ventilate (seconds) | Apnea (seconds)  |
| -----------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1          | 120                 | 120              |
| 2          | 105                 | 120              |
| 3          | 90                  | 120              |
| 4          | 75                  | 120              |
| 5          | 60                  | 120              |
| 6          | 45                  | 120              |
| 7          | 30                  | 120              |
| 8          | 15                  | 120              |


### O<sub>2</sub> Table

| Repetition | Ventilate (seconds) | Apnea (seconds)  |
| -----------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1          | 120                 | 90               |
| 2          | 120                 | 105              |
| 3          | 120                 | 120              |
| 4          | 120                 | 135              |
| 5          | 120                 | 150              |
| 6          | 120                 | 165              |
| 7          | 120                 | 180              |
| 8          | 120                 | 195              |


### Pranayama Table

| Repetition | Ventilate (seconds) | Apnea (seconds)  |
| -----------| --------------------|------------------|
| 1          | 5                   | 5                |
| 2          | 5                   | 5                |
| 3          | 5                   | 5                |
| 4          | 5                   | 5                |
| 5          | 5                   | 5                |
| 6          | 5                   | 5                |
| 7          | 5                   | 5                |
| 8          | 5                   | 5                |


### Table shorthand

The tables are commonly referred as (duration x repetitions) with many people that I spoke with.  In the case of CO<sub>2</sub> tables, it is (duration of apnea) x repetitions whereas in CO<sub>2</sub> it is (duration of ventilation) x duration.


## Mobile Apps

I thought it would be useful to see if there were any phone apps out there for usage as I am constantly with my phone for better or worse. Breathing tables are easy to generate but for a small price, there are some great apps to do the work for you and guide the process.  If you are an iOS user as well, I have done the work of reviewing several iOS applications and found these 2 applications to be useful.


#### Apnea Diver

Pros:

  * Supports 3 default tables (CO2, O2, Pranayama)

  * Voice count down

  * Custom table generation

  * Initial app walkthru was great

  * Has a skip button between breathing rounds should you not live up to expectations

Cons:

  * Voice count down stops working sporadically

  * Not sure why it wants to integrate with Facebook

#### STAmina Apnea Trainer

Pros:

  * Voice countdown works like a champ

  * Voice can be configured to male or female should you care

  * The user interface is simpler than Apnea Diver

Cons:

  * The settings are less robust than Apnea Diver

  * The learning curve was higher as the application didn't have a walk thru
