Today was buried deep in Agile process from stand-up to demo to retrospective.  Most of today's notes will be Agile related.

Things I sucked at today:

  * Starting Soylent. I had no motivation to do so today.

  * Debugging an issue with spark submit configuration parameters not being applied correctly.  It was hard coded in the code that I was working with.  #FAIL

Things I'm committing to today:

  * Getting boost to build from [new_git_repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/234) instead of using [mzhaom's](https://github.com/mzhaom/trunk) work.

  * Ensuring my data backups work after watching [How Google Backs Up The Internet](https://youtu.be/eNliOm9NtCM).  It has been awhile since I simulated an oh crap the hard drive died moment on any of my machines so I am probably due to ensure my back ups are valid.

  * Exercising more.  I have been sucking in that department for the last 2 months.

Things that I am grateful for:

  * Demos that work.  It doesn't always work when you need it but today the demo Gods were on our side.

Things I learned today:

  * Peer reviewing often fails teams

  * Large retrospective sessions are unmanageable

  * I dislike game style retrogames such as Spotify's [Squad Health Check](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/).

Things I plan to do tomorrow:

  * [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com) I'm really going to do it this time!
