Algorithms and Data Structures:

I stumbled across a [great post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12871234) in HackerNews about the 
MIT Advanced Data Structures course that I had been going thru.  There was a great reference to yet another 
[algorithms course](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) that I plan to also go thru.  It is by 
Jeff Erickson and it appears to go deep which is my kind of course.  There is also a PDF of course available 
[here](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/everything.pdf).

Another notable read from this week:

Useful StackOverflow posts this week:
