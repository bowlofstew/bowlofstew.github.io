#FAIL

I spent most of the day dealing with fallout of someone pushing out breaking changes to a microservice.  There is something to be said for medium sized tests that test for this kind of breaking change.  It was basically the equivalent of changing a REST endpoint from:

	GET /foo?bar=1
	{
		"thing": 1	
	}

to

	GET /foo?bar=1&parameter=lame_default_value_that_old_consumers_are_expected_to_pass
	{
		"thing": 1,
		"lame_default_value_that_old_consumers_are_expected_to_pass": "default"
	}

Great value add, eh?  Did I forget to mention that the former endpoint no longer functions (backwards compatibility, who needs that).  Never do this unless you really want an entire team to hate you.

Learning:

  * I learned about modes of thinking (focused, diffuse) in the Coursera [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course along with some introduction to memory items.  This has been interesting so far and recommend others come on board for the ride.

  * Consumed yet more CppCon presentation materials....long weekend ahead!
