I have spent several months reading option trading textbooks.  In the process, I have compiled a list of the ones that I have deemed the best from my learning.  As someone who worked in the trading industry for years, I was looking for something that had more depth than those that may be looking for an introduction.

The first textbook reviews several instruments.  It provides a purely academic treatment of all of the subjects.  Additionally, there are a number of questions at the end of each chapter that you can work thru after your reading.

This text is a balance between an academic and practitioner's approach.  It covers several complex options trading strategies that aren't covered in the previous approach.

This text is focused on the practitioner's approach.  It often connects back to the academic approach.  I found this to be my favorite textbook with a large amount of worked examples.
