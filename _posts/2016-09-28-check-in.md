Today I started to take the [Computer Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch) course on Coursera. Seems good so far but I am only 3 lectures deep.

Articles I'm reading:

  * [An Efficient Algorithm for Exploiting Multiple Arithmetic Units](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.4915&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

  * [The strange details of std string at Facebook](https://github.com/bowlofstew/CppCon2016/blob/master/Presentations/The%20strange%20details%20of%20std%20string%20at%20Facebook/The%20strange%20details%20of%20std%20string%20at%20Facebook%20-%20Nicholas%20Ormrod%20-%20CppCon%202016.pdf)

 Videos I watched:

  * [CppCon 2016: Manuel Klimek â€œDeploying C++ modules to 100s of millions of lines of code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHFNpBfemDI)

Things that went wrong today:

  * Spark cluster stability in one of our DC/OS environments was not good

  * Capacity planning not being performed diligently by others - if you are going to deploy an application, it is best to plan for the resources to be used and not rely on someone elses work.  #NotSayingAnyNames

  * Clothing failure.  Today Chicago skipped Fall and went into Winter.  I was underdressed.

  * Being exposed to a new virus.  Given that almost everyone on my team was sick today and decided to come to work and share, I suspect this weekend will be shot as my body comes to grips with this virus.

Things that went well today:

  * Mentoring junior developers to the finer points of the ElasticSearch, Java API

  * Cleaning up several compiler warnings

  * Cleaning up several logging issues

  * Increasing unit test coverage
