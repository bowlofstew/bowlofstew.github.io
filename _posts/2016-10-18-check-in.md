Deployment checklists

For a first deployment to a new environment, it is valuable to have a run book or deployment checklist to validate.  It is even better if this is automated but in many workplaces this is relegated to a manual quality assurance team.  This list typically includes steps like:

  1.  Validate the build information (MANIFEST.MF in Java, Assembly.cs in C# for example).

  2.  Validate APIs are operational.

  3.  Validate metrics are going to a metrics store.  Can you provide others with a service level indicators for your application?

  4.  Validate health checks are operational.  Most distributed systems will restart this until this passes but it never hurts to check this if you are in manual validation mode.

  5.  Validate logs are being written. 

  6.  Validate application performance.

  7.  Validate application configurations.  Did you point to the correct resources (databases, load balancers, whatever)?

  8.  Is security in place?

  9.  Failover strategies in place?

  10. Alerts in place for full hard drives, system crashes, etc?

This is merely an example list.  Make a list of all of this manual work and automate this.  More releases will be coming down the pipe as long as the work keeps coming.  Manual work doesn't scale well.
