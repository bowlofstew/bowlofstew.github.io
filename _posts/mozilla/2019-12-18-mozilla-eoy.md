2019 @ Mozilla
---

I joined Mozilla in July of 2019 and it was an interesting 5 months.   During that 
time I was able to assist in setting up a subscription management platform, assist in 
a few root cause analysis (RCA), assist in requirements gathering, and meet some cool 
people along the way.

The on-boarding process was a fantastic aspect and they went the distance compared to 
other places to disseminate the culture, values, and how we work there.

Onwards to 2020!
