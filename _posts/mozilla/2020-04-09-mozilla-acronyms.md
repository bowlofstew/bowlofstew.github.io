Acronyms, Nicknames, and specific definitions @ Mozilla
---

A confusing part of being a software engineer at Mozilla is all of the acronyms at play.  Given the open source nature of Mozilla, I have created a listing of those that I encounter 
often and am sharing those here along with links that point to those resources.  There are certainly tons more but these have been beneficial to me as I ramp up.

Acronyms: 
  
  * AMO -> addons.mozilla.org

  * BMO -> Bugzilla

  * FxA -> Firefox Accounts

  * IC -> Individual Contributor

  * MAU -> Monthly Average User

  * MDN -> Mozilla Developer Network

  * MoCo -> Mozilla Corporation

  * MoFo -> Mozilla Foundation

  * ML -> Machine Learning

  * SUMO -> support.mozilla.org

Nicknames:

  * Fenix -> Firefox Android Browser

  * Mana -> Confluence

Jargon:

  * Chemspill -> an urgent problem in a product that requires immediate effort in response. 

  * Face mute -> When you are on a video call and turn your camera off.  Example: "I am going face mute while I fetch a cup of coffee."

Random Learning of the Day:

The word Hydra has many meanings:

* [Hydra of Mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra)

* [Hydra of comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(comics))

I only knew of the first and apparently am not well versed in comics.
