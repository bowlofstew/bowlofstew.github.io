*The Greate Mental Models*

This series is from Shane Parrish of [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog) and are 2 volumes of a 5 volume series.  I have enjoyed the treatment of mental models in this series better than the others listed.  I liked the broad survey of models listed in Super Thinking by Gabriel Weinberg, founder of [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) but found it to be just enough to gain interest in it but too light on real-world applicability.  This is where Shane's series shines, taking the theoretical to practical.
