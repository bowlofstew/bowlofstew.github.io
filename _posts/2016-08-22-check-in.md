I'm trying to get into a better habit of blogging so I'll start with daily check-ins (hopefully).

Things I'm committing to today:

  * [Bazel](http://bazel.io/) - I have been using it personally since it open sourced and now have built up enough of a knowledge-base to push for it at the company that I am at.

  * Listening to [The Tao of Seneca](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Seneca-Practical-Letters-Master/dp/B01AIXEJ0U)

Things I learned today:

  * Running Spark applications on a Mesos framework is incredibly difficult due to it's nebulous configuration.  

  * Deploying long-running (not scheduled but start and let it run until) applications to Spark is not well supported.  Creating a custom framework in Python is probably the best approach since [DCOS Spark](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-spark) is already written in Python.

  * Some codebases are meant for trunk-based development.

  * Yolo commit messages via whatthecommit.com are awesome.

Things I plan to do tomorrow:

  * [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com) My wife and I are experimenting with it.
