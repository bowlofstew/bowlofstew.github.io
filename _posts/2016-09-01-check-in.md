Today marks the beginning of a long weekend and the end of a 2 day release planning for our software extravaganza (sigh of relief).

Good things:

  * Continued planning for the next 2 months (again).

  * Deployed a [Preso cluster](https://prestodb.io) today to a [DCOS](https://dcos.io/) environment.  Presto is a distributed SQL query engine for big data.  I have been wanting to deploy this into our environment for some time now and today was the day.  I still don't have the connector catalog quite sorted out but it is getting close.

  * Increased amount of team members for our team (we have a backlog for awhile to put it mildly).  What I am trying to say here is if you need a job and are a good programmer, ping me!

Bad things:

  * Worked on project planning for the next 2 months (again).

Projects that I started:

  * Creating a small Bazel, Python demo project for understanding best practices in that environment.

  * Adding in Scala tests to the previous [Bazel Scala/Java mixed demo](https://github.com/bowlofstew/bazel-java-scala) that I started.

Articles that I read:

  * The paper is ["Apache Spark @Scale: A 60 TB+ production use case"](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1671373793181703/apache-spark-scale-a-60-tb-production-use-case/) and covers unsurprisingly, running large scale analytics.  The problem that I am presently tackling is a similar but smaller scale problem.  There are some great tuning gems in there.
