Super productive day!  It felt like a Monday but working from home the previous day has that effect on a person.  

  * Debugged an interesting distributed problem (wish I could go into more detail)

  * Listened to [CppCon 2016 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wzc7a3McOs)

  * Watched parts of the [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home) Coursera course.

  * Disliked Scala more than yesterday
