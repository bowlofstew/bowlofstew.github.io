Today I learned that:

  * Debugging issues in complex Avro schemas is non-trivial.  This was definitely not like debugging protocol buffer issues in the past.

  * Mentoring junior developers is still fun.

  * The Wifi on the train never works as you'd expect (SouthShoreWifi-32).

  * [Google Play Music's](https://play.google.com/music) recommendation algorithm seems better than Pandora.

  * The chunking process to learn new information does work.

  * Adding in a [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer for learning and work tasks appears to be increasing efficiency so far.

At work:

  * We had a healthy debate on whether or not developers should have admin access (we used to but no longer).  It seems reasonable for developers (at least back-end) to perform their jobs.

  * Fought Avro and Avro won.

  * Peformed mentoring of a few junior devlopers.

  * Reviewed a handful of pull requests (PR).

Productivity wins:

  * Closing my email client.

  * Closing Slack.

This weekend was spent solidly on reviewing the presentation materials from CppCon2016 and reading thru the [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL) codebase.  If you haven't had the chance to read thru that codebase yet, I highly recommend it.

Other great C++ codebases to review:

Electronic Arts:

  * [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL)

Facebook:

  * [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly)

  * [Wangle](https://github.com/facebook/wangle)
