*Conference Recap*
-----

Our company, Channel IQ, just had the privilege to go to the GOTO Chicago
conference.  It was phenomenal & thanks to all for making it a great success!  My
personal favorite presentations were those given by the guys of DRW & Thoughtworks:

*[x86 Internals for Fun and Profit:]({{ site.url }}/assets/MattGodbolt_X86InternalsForFunAndProfit.pdf)*
This brought back excellent memories of hacking around on the x86 from days long past, thanks!

*[Technology Management, WTF?:]({{ site.url }}/assets/DerekGroothuis_and_LyleHayhurst_TechnologyManagementWTF.pdf)*
This presentation provided excellent insight into why as a developer, you may
think your manager is insane!

There were several great presentations and most of the slide decks are [available](http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/schedule/index.jsp).

I'll leave you with an interview with Tim Bray, a co-founder of the XML specification, who
spoke on Tuesday evenings keynote.
