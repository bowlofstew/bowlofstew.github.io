I have spent the 2 months deep in following [Handmade Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive/playlists) video series. &nbsp;The project seeks to write a 2-D game by hand using no external libraries, etc. &nbsp;It has been a great series so far for getting back into Windows graphics (Yes, it has been awhile for me!). &nbsp;I also enjoy the [rants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlcmxvQfzKQ) on OOP as it mirrors my own thoughts as well.

Handmade had a very successful conference which was recorded. &nbsp;They had several great speakers there including Mike Acton. &nbsp;The video is available [here](https://youtu.be/H_cpWfRblws).

Earlier, this week I noticed that there was a project called [Handmade Quake](http://philipbuuck.com/announcing-handmade-quake) that [Philip Buuck](https://github.com/philipbuuck) formed. &nbsp;The project seeks to walk thru the source code of Quake and modernize it for use in Visual Studio 2015/Windows 10. &nbsp;This project definite intrigues me as I fondly recall playing Quake as a child.
