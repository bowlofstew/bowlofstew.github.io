Things that went well today:

  * Working from home on a Friday.

  * Migration of a Chronos job to Marathon

Good finds:

  * [Practical C++ Metaprogramming, Modern Techniques for Accelerated Development](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/practical-c-plus-plus-metaprogramming.csp) - Free and seems good so far.

  * [C++ Slack](http://cpplang.diegostamigni.com/) - This was an awesome find and seems like a great community.

  * [STL From Scratch](http://voidae.com/blog/2016/9/28/stl-from-scratch-introduction) - This looks to be an awesome upcoming blog series.
