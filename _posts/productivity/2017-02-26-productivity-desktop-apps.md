*Productivity Apps, OSX Edition*
-----

During the course of writing my new book, I began to cleanup and re-evaluate the 
applications that I use on a day to day basis.  I am constantly looking to save time wherever possible.  Here are my results 
for OSX presently.  Other operating systems to follow soon:

Music:

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)
This holds my several playlists from winding down to working out.
  
[Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/)
I use this as background music for when I am trying to get in the zone.

Time Management:

[Tomight](http://tomighty.org/)
Pomodoro timer, simple interface with nothing fancy.  Great to go heads down on a project.

Composition:

[Scrivener 2](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) 
I use this for composing my new book and various research documents.

[Spark Email](https://sparkmailapp.com/) 
The best email client that I have found for OSX.

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
I do all of my journaling, notetaking, and work related write-ups here.

Browsers & Extensions:

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
A decent web browser ;)

[Signal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk)
I use this for messaging friends and family.

[Pocket](getpocket.com)
Anything that is TL;DR goes to pocket.  This is especially useful for Hacker News items that
I find but am in the middle of something.

[OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall)
Tired of having 300 tabs open in Chrome.  This provides an innovative solution to 
managing this common problem.

[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
One of multiple password managers that I use.

[Ad Nausem](https://adnauseam.io/)
This extension, removed from the Chromestore can still be installed manually.  It 
provides all of the ad blocking potential of other ad blockers but also provides confusion 
 to the advertisers by randomly clicking ads on your behalf.

File Sharing:

[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

Software Development:

[Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
C and C++ development

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Python development

[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
Java & Scala development

Security:

[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
One of multiple password managers that I use.

[Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
All command line, all password manager.  Backed by git too!
