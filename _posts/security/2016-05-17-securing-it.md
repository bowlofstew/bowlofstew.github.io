It is time again for my annual system security tune-up across every device I own or manage.  For the OSX based systems, I found [this](https://github.com/drduh/OS-X-Security-and-Privacy-Guide) guide to be very helpful.  Here are the high-points:

  * VPN -> [CyberGhost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com)

  * Browser -> [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).  More on this later as I tweaked it out pretty hard.

  * DNS -> [DNSCrypt](https://github.com/alterstep/dnscrypt-osxclient)

  * Full disk encryption, turn it on

  * Install hosts file level blocking, [source](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)

  * Anti-virus -> nope, nope, nope.

  * Instant messaging -> Adium w/OTR &

  * Password manager -> [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

  * Backups -> [Arq Backup](https://www.arqbackup.com/) with encryption

There are many good settings in the first mentioned article that you should consider applying.  I have tweaked my setup with them and have only covered the high points here.
