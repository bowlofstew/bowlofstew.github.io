### 2018, Week 43 - Weekly Learning

After a long stint of not writing, I am back at it.  This week was filled with many opportunities for personal improvement both personally and professionally.

#### Professional (inside of work)

* Performed deep SQL query profiling.

* Created tooling to enable automated SQL query profiling that involved docker and C#.

* Performed interviews for several positions such as Principle QA Engineer, Principle Engineer, and Team Lead positions.

* Created several internal slide decks on .NET internals and basic to advanced testing concepts.

#### Professional (outside of work)

* [Time-Series Modelling in FoundationDB](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/time-series.html) - I spent a chunk of my time understanding the best way to model time-series data in [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb) prior to migration from [Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra).  Speaking of FoundationDB, [the FoundationDB Summit was announced](https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-summit-program-announced/).

* [gRPC-Web](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/10/24/grpc-web-is-going-ga/) went generally available!

* A great write-up of [swiss tables and absl::hash](https://abseil.io/blog/20180927-swisstables) was published.

#### Professional Giving Back

I have begun to give back my previous learning albeit slowly.  As part of this, I have started to push out various project's at Github.  This week's efforts were to publish Bazel based learnings to Github.  Here are the offers and description:

  * [Bazel Workbench](https://github.com/bowlofstew/bazel-workbench) - A workbench showing the use of multiple technologies, frameworks, and languages from within the [Bazel build system](https://www.bazel.build/).

  * [Bazel C++ Demo](https://github.com/bowlofstew/bazel-cpp-demo) - A basic demonstration of using [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) to compile C++ code.

#### Personal Purchases

* [Fluent Forever App](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fluent-forever-app-think-in-any-new-language#/updates/all) - I purchased the multiple languages pack and have enjoyed the beta versions released so far this month.  I have long struggled with foreign language learning and after reading the original [Fluent Forever Book](https://amzn.to/2CF8HdY), this seemed to be the must have program.  It certainly beats managing multiple card sets in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

* [Lou Malnati's Crustless Pizza](https://www.loumalnatis.com/blog/2010/08/crustless-not-your-average-deep-dish/) - Being on a ketogenic diet for 2 years, this is an eating out event that I highly appreciate.  I can put away 
a large pizza by myself.
