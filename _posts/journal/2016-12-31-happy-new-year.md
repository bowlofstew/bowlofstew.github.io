### Goodbye 2016, Hello 2017


I'm glad to see you go 2016.  Out with the old and in with the new.  In 2016 
we saw the US equity market indices hit all time highs but few new 
[tech IPOs](http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=filings).  We 
also saw several companies/groups close up show:

  * [Parse](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/)

  * [Google Compare](https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/23/google-is-closing-google-compare-its-financial-services-comparison-service/)

  * [ITT Tech](https://gizmodo.com/itt-is-officially-closing-1786243058) - This needed to 
  happen long ago.

  * [Terminal.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12402764)

  * [Cyanogen](http://betanews.com/2016/12/26/cyanogenmod-dies-lineage-os-is-born/)

  * [Skype London](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/17/12951996/skype-london-office-closing-layoffs?yptr=yahoo)

  * [FriendsUnited](https://medium.com/@liife/friendsreunited-the-sunset-of-an-era-3e5b2ea7bb11#.1wg1bl16q)

  * [HyperTable](http://www.hypertable.com/blog/hypertable_inc._is_closing_its_doors/)

  * [PyVideo](http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/pyvideo/status_20160115.html)

  * [CoinKite](http://blog.coinkite.com/post/141836920461/time-to-be-your-own-bank)

  * [Vine](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/technology/vine-is-closing-down-and-the-internet-cant-stand-it.html?_r=0)

  * [Revolv](http://uk.businessinsider.com/googles-nest-closing-smart-home-company-revolv-bricking-devices-2016-4?r=DE&IR=T)

And there are so many more.  Additionally we saw a [game engine company](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/287468/Report_Crytek_once_again_failing_to_pay_its_developers_on_time.php) show major 
signs of closing in early 2017.  Furthermore, Sears still [can't get it together](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-25/sears-posts-second-quarter-loss-as-decline-in-sales-persists).  I am surprised that Sears didn't die long ago.

It wasn't a bad year in the Chicago tech sector:

  * The company I was working with, Channel IQ, was [acquired](https://markettrack.com/market-trackllc-acquires-channel-iq).

  * The company I joined, Uptake, hit a [valuation of 1 Billion](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/business/dealbook/midwest-start-up-achieves-rare-dollar1-billion-valuation.html?_r=0).

  * [Drivin](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150704/ISSUE01/307049996/a-new-model-for-the-used-car-business) locked in 10 million

  * [Ocient](http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2016/07/26/after-selling-cleversafe-for-1-3b-chris-gladwin-unveils-ocient/) was opened its doors.  The CEO of Cleversafe founded it after his exit.

### Keep it looking up in 2017 Chicago
