Things that I found awesome:

  * The IntelliJ Bazel plugin

  * Getting a caching system setup in Python using dogpile and Redis to make portfolio computations faster

Things that I sucked at:

  * Finding the bottlekneck for performance of a Spark job

Blog posts that I am digging:

  * [How (and why) I made a zine](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/29/how-i-made-a-zine/).  Super inspiring post to make me want to create a zine.  I didn't realize the barrier of entry was so low!

Github repos I am looking at today:

  * [Modern CMake presentation](https://github.com/toeb/moderncmake)

  * [Baidu Parallel Distributed Deep Learning](https://github.com/baidu/Paddle)

Books that I am reading:

  * [The Magic of Thinking Big](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Thinking-Big-David-Schwartz/dp/0671646788)
