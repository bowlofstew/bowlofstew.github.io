## About

I am a senior software engineer at Uptake Technologies.  They specialize in providing solutions for very complex problems involving massive amounts of data from the internet of things (IoT).  Previously, I worked at a company that specialized in price monitoring of products on the internet and before that, some high-frequency trading firms.

My interests are varying:

  *  Algorithms

  *  Chemistry

  *  Fitness

  *  Nuclear Engineering
